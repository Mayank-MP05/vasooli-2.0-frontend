# Vasooli - The Money Manager Frontend

#### Rough Planning 
- There are modals for some actions:

a. login/signup modal

b. transaction add/edit modal
c. transaction delete confirm modal

e. vasooli add/edit modal
f. vasooli delete confirm modal

g. profile update confirm modal

- Three Main Page routes

a. profile - shows the profile details and option to edit the profile
b. transactions - shows the list of transactions to be added 
c. vasoolis - shows the list of vasoolis to be added

Features to think of:
- React Skeleton
- Better Icons
- Redux and Store setup
- Account Notifications
- API calls alert

Common Components Planning
- Top Navigation Bar
- Container to hold whatever route specific component is There
- NotificationTray 
- Transaction list 
- Vasooli list
